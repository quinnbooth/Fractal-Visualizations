## How to Use

First, visit the website above. Once there, click on a fractal that catches your interest and start experimenting with the available controls.<br><br>This project has been optimized for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. Theoretically, it should work on other browsers too. Enjoy your exploration of the fascinating world of fractals!<br><br>

# How it Works

The hub page provides access to five different fractal visualizations. Each visualization is dynamically updated using an algorithm to create an interactive experience.<br><br>

## Barnsley Fern
<br>
The Barnsley Fern and its variants are fascinating fractals that are generated through the use of probabilistic matrix operations. The process begins by plotting a single point, and then its coordinates are transformed using a specific matrix operation. These matrix operations involve multiplication by a matrix [[A, B], [C, D]] and subsequent addition with [[E], [F]]. This transformation is repeated multiple times, resulting in a sequence of points that eventually form an intricate fern-like image.<br>

The probabilistic nature of the process adds an element of randomness to the transformations. At each iteration, the specific matrix operation to be applied is chosen based on a set of probabilities associated with each transformation. This probabilistic aspect contributes to the self-similarity and complexity observed in the final fractal image.<br>

By applying these matrix operations and repeating the process numerous times, the Barnsley Fern and its variants emerge, exhibiting the characteristic patterns and structures reminiscent of natural ferns.<br><br>

## L-System Tree
<br>
A Lindenmayer System, or L-system, is a formal grammar that transforms strings of symbols using predefined rules. Through iterative application of these rules, L-systems generate complex structures, including fractal trees. By manipulating symbols within the strings, L-systems capture self-similarity and recursion, allowing for the creation of interesting patterns and branching structures<br>

The L-system algorithm revolves around rewriting symbols based on a set of rules. Starting with an initial string, known as the axiom, the system repeatedly applies these rules to each symbol, generating new sequences in a step-by-step fashion. For example, all 'F' characters in the string might be replaced with '+F-'. At some depth, this process halts and we are provided a string for image generation.<br>

The generated string is composed of symbols that represent instructions. These symbols guide the movement and drawing actions of our cursor. For example, certain symbols instruct the cursor to change its facing angle, while others command it to draw a line in the current direction. Some symbols are responsible for saving coordinates, allowing us to return to previously visited positions. Following the instructions represented by the L-System output string can manifest fractals such as those above.<br><br>

## Mandelbrot Set
<br>
The Mandelbrot Set algorithm explores the properties of complex numbers. Starting with a complex number 'c', we repeatedly apply the function f(z) = z^2 + c to generate a sequence of iterated values for 'z'. The key observation is that if, during this iteration, the magnitude of 'z' remains bounded, indicating that it does not grow infinitely large, then 'c' is part of the Mandelbrot Set.<br><br>

</p><br>
By mapping the x-y coordinates on our canvas to the real and imaginary components of a point 'c' in the complex plane, we can determine whether the following iterated values of 'z' diverge to infinity or remain bounded. Doing this for every coordinate yields an image of the Mandelbrot Set.<br><br>

## Spirograph
<br>
Spirograph Fractals are created by simulating the motion of circles rotating around each other, just like in a traditional pen and paper spirograph. As the circles revolve, they trace out repetitive patterns on the plane. While these patterns may not adhere strictly to the rigorous mathematical definition of fractals, they sometimes possess fractal-like characteristics with self-similar structures.<br><br>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="./images/spirograph.PNG" alt="Snowflake Spirograph" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px; height: auto; object-fit: cover;">

    <td>

      <p align="center"><em>Figure 8: Donut Spirograph</em></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
In addition to 2D patterns, this algorithm has the capability to simulate 3D images. By adjusting the speeds of each rotating circle, a wide range of drawings with unique characteristics can be achieved.<br><br>

## Julia Set
<br>
The Julia Set algorithm is closely related to the Mandelbrot Set and explores the behavior of complex numbers under the iterative function f(z) = z^2 + c. While the Mandelbrot Set examines the behavior of 'z' starting from z = 0 and varying the constant 'c', the Julia Set focuses on a fixed 'c'.<br><br>

</p><br>
Like the Mandelbrot Set, we map the x-y coordinates of our canvas to the real and imaginary components of a complex number: this time they act as our initial 'z', rather than the constant 'c'. We can then determine whether the following iterated values of 'z' diverge to infinity or remain bounded. If bounded, that x-y pairing should be contained within our Julia Set. By additionally varying 'c', numerous distinct fractals emerge.
