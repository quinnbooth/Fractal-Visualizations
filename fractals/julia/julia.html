            Spirograph Fractals are generated similarly to a pen and paper spirograph.
            Circles rotate around one another to create repeating patterns. These patterns
            are not strictly fractals as you will see. Rather, this algorithm can emulate fractals.
            It is even better at drawing 3D images.
